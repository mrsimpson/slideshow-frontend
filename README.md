# Slideshow frontend

Webapps for enabling realtime interactions between presenter and audience in a remote presentation.

## Motivation

Event after the times of Covid, remote presentations are usual. This leaves the presenter detached from the audience by default.
Slideshow aims at bridging this gap between presenter and audience.

## What it ~~does~~ shall do in future

- Provide [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/)-alike options for interacting with the audience.
- Webapps for the presenter and participants of the presentation: React (with emojis), ask questions
- Reusable vue components which can be integrated into the awesome [sli.dev](https://sli.dev)

## Stack

- vue3. Nuxt is intentionally excluded as the app shall be deployable without the need of a server (e. g. on GH pages)
- Jest for unit-testing
- Playwright for integration testin (if necessary)

## Status

Big WIP. It's a side project of a father with two children. Expect not much progress.
